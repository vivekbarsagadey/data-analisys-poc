Vector Autoregression Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (VARMAX)
The Vector Autoregression Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (VARMAX) is an extension of the VARMA model that also includes the modeling of exogenous variables. It is a multivariate version of the ARMAX method.

Exogenous variables are also called covariates and can be thought of as parallel input sequences that have observations at the same time steps as the original series. The primary series(es) are referred to as endogenous data to contrast it from the exogenous sequence(s). The observations for exogenous variables are included in the model directly at each time step and are not modeled in the same way as the primary endogenous sequence (e.g. as an AR, MA, etc. process).

The VARMAX method can also be used to model the subsumed models with exogenous variables, such as VARX and VMAX.

The method is suitable for multivariate time series without trend and seasonal components with exogenous variables.
