Holt Winter’s Exponential Smoothing (HWES)
The Holt Winter’s Exponential Smoothing (HWES) also called the Triple Exponential Smoothing method models the next time step as an exponentially weighted linear function of observations at prior time steps, taking trends and seasonality into account.
The method is suitable for univariate time series with trend and/or seasonal components.

# HWES example

# contrived dataset
data = [x + random() for x in range(1, 100)]
# fit model
model = ExponentialSmoothing(data)
model_fit = model.fit()
# make prediction
yhat = model_fit.predict(len(data), len(data))
